# Static Site Generator

This is the second guided project on [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/).\
The following is excerpted from the [course introduction](https://www.boot.dev/learn/build-static-site-generator).

> Build a static site generator from scratch, similar to Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby in Python.\
> Ever wondered how SEO and performance-optimized static site generators like Hugo work? In this guided project you'll build your own from scratch using Python. You'll put a lot of your learnings from Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming to use in a tangible web project. This project isn't for the faint of heart, but it's well worth the effort. You'll come away with a deeper understanding of static content management.
